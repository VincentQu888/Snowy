It is our sincere pleasure to serve the students families and staff members in the York Region District School Board. We have both spent the majority if not all of our careers in education at York Region District School Board and throughout that time have seen such a genuine level of care and commitment to student learning achievement and well-being. 

We recognize that there will always be more work to do to ensure we are providing students with an education that meets their diverse learning needs and prepares them for the future and that we are creating identity-affirming environments where all members of our community feel valued respected safe and welcomed.. Every day we see passionate and driven members of our school community striving to do just that and in the process making a real difference in the lives of our students and their families. 

It is a privilege to lead this organization and work with such a dedicated team of staff in partnership with families and community to serve the students and families of York Region. The students in our system inspire us every day and we will continue to centre their learning achievement and well-being in all that we do as an organization. 

As the outgoing Director of Education I want to thank students families staff members and community partners for all that you do to make this organization what it is. It was an honour to serve this community as your Director and I feel very optimistic about the future because of the people who make up YRDSB. Each day that I have served in this role I have seen a level of engagement commitment and determination that is inspiring and I know our incoming Director of Education knows our system well is a caring and strategic leader and is passionate about delivering the very best for the YRDSB community.

Over the last three weeks with the support of community organizations and other donors students at ECSS and five other summer school locations have had access to nutritional snacks. Such initiatives play a role in fostering a supportive and caring environment as they demonstrate a commitment to the well-being of all students. This initiative provided several benefits among the student population; students had access to nutritional food that assisted in their concentration energy level and well-being as well as their overall sense of mattering and belonging.

With summer school at an end Pierre Berton Resource Library has stepped up to continue supporting this initiative. Through the collaboration with @VaughanPublicLibraries students can know they can access snacks in the youth area at Pierre Berton Resource Library whenever the library is open.
