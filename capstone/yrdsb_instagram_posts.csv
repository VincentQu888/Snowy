Since the outset the Board has worked with third party legal and technology experts to ensure an appropriate and effective response. We have also engaged law enforcement.

Regrettably we have now confirmed that data was taken by those who compromised our network.¬† It will take time to analyze the data and determine who is affected and how. The current analysis indicates that the greatest potential risk of exposure is to a limited number of our current employees. While students and parents may also be affected their potential exposure is limited. The school based online payment system ‚ÄúSchoolCash Online‚Äù Edsby Teach Assist and student information systems were not affected by this incident and data collected and stored in those systems continues to be secure.¬†

¬†

What is Black to you? To me it's me - I am Black. How did I realize that? I don't really remember but I was always attracted to people with lighter complexions since my earliest memories living in a small village in Kenya. The reason I made this video is to share my unscripted thoughts on Blackness even as I continue to discover my true self.

"Mno Anishinaabe Giizhigad (Happy Anishinaabe Day).

Today we recognize the second national observance of Anishinaabe Giizhigad which is a celebration specific to the @anishinabeknation.

Here's a little more background about the day. https://youtu.be/7mwGnf1klIk

Our social media team had the honour of attending a celebration @yrdsb_sdhs led by Ms. Johnston who teaches the Ojibwe language class.

Students learned about Indigenous innovations and matched up contemporary versions to their Indigenous inspired counterparts. 

Students were also able to scan QR codes to learn more information about the innovations and their names in Anishinaabemowin. Anishinaabemowin is how you say Ojibwe in the language. 

We'll be sharing some of these Indigenous innovations throughout the month and invite our followers to learn alongside us.

A diverse group of students are filming multiple versions of the Land Acknowledgment which will include English French and American Sign Language (ASL) to ensure accessibility for our schools within the York Region District School Board. 

The project originated from a request by a specialist teacher for an ASL version to cater to deaf and hard-of-hearing students. As a community we must emphasize the importance of inclusivity understanding and respect for Indigenous communities highlighting the value of caring for the land and waters. 

These 3 versions of the Land Acknowledgement will be available next year for our schools.

I came to this country as an immigrant and I had wonderful teachers who provided support guidance and empowerment. This support has helped to mild the person I am today.

"Please take a few moments to read this message from Director Yake regarding supporting the YRDSB 2SLGBTQIA+ community. 

As a school board we support the use of social media platforms when used as effective and respectful teaching learning and communications tools. I applaud the 1000‚Äôs of staff students and community members that do just that on a regular basis. However recently and far too often we are seeing incidents of hate threats and bullying in various ways and on various platforms. This is both concerning and totally unacceptable. It is for this reason the ‚Äòcomments‚Äô feature on the Board‚Äôs Twitter account was turned off in November 2022. This small measure was to shield our students staff and families from unnecessary and unacceptable hate hurt and harm. 

It is both concerning and heartbreaking when we see comments of this nature at any time but especially on posts that are meant to celebrate give visibility be identity-affirming and show support to our diverse and marginalized communities. This week for example targeted and offensive threats have occurred directed towards the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. This is a community that has unfortunately seen a recent increase in incidents of hate both online and in person including a hateful ‚Äúprotest‚Äù at one of our elementary schools. It deeply saddens me that the 2SLGBTQIA+ community have been targeted in this way and I know our senior team share these feelings. We stand with our community and remain committed to ensuring all of our students feel safe welcome seen and celebrated in our schools and workplaces. This includes our students staff and families who identify as 2SLGBTQIA+. These recent incidents have been addressed and the targeting of marginalized communities will not be tolerated at our Board. 

We will continue to unapologetically celebrate and affirm the diverse identities of our students staff and community members throughout YRDSB. Hateful comments will not deter us from doing what is in the best interest of our communities and I applaud all who continue to promote equity diversity and inclusion across our Board.

"Our first submission for Celebrating Black Excellence - Black Voices comes from our Associate Director of Education Equitable Outcomes and Schools Cecil Roach!

In this video Mr. Roach shares an important Canadian history lesson that is also part of his own personal history. 

During his long career as a teacher vice principal principal superintendent and now Associate Director Mr. Cecil Roach has always maintained that he has had the opportunity to have a very profound impact on the lives of young people.

He is the proud son of the recently deceased Mary Roach a West Indian Domestic. Mary was one of 5000 West Indian women who between 1955 and 1964 came to Canada on the West Indian Domestic Scheme.

Arriving in Canada in his early teens Mr. Roach completed most of his schooling in Montreal and holds Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degrees from Concordia and McGill Universities. He maintains that his time as one who has been termed the ‚Äúbarrel children‚Äù (children whose parents left them behind with a grandparent while they prepare for their reunion in Canada) has given him a special insight into the dynamics of immigration and its impact on student achievement and well- being. This experience has also strengthened Mr. Roach‚Äôs belief that schools are places where all students must be given the opportunity to expand their dreams on their journey towards full participation in Canadian society.

Here's Jordan from the curriculum math team sharing how we can centre community voice in classrooms and schools.¬†

¬†

Jordan‚Äôs passion for mathematics education was sparked once he had kids of his own leading to a profound interest in the development of student thinking and reasoning. His practice is guided by the roles identity community and storytelling have in uncovering a sense of wonder belief and belonging for all especially students and communities who have and continue to face oppression. He believes when we value and honor the experiences we all have we nurture learning spaces that provide greater access for all learners to take part in meaningful rich and intellectually engaging mathematics. What emerges from here are classrooms and schools rooted in solidarity and allyship nurtured through the growth and success of the collective. Jordan spent 17 years as a classroom teacher and currently works as a Regional Mathematics Facilitator providing professional learning and in-class support for educators in the York Region District School Board in Ontario Canada. He writes problem-based units with the Make Math Moments community serves on the Research and Advocacy Committee with the Coalition for Alternatives to Streaming in Education (CASE) and speaks at local national and international conferences on a variety of topics such as Thinking Flexibly to Develop Fluency Teaching Through Problems Worth Solving and Disrupting Special Education Structures: Supporting De-Streaming in Elementary Mathematics.",0

"‚ÄúExcellence is placing the needs and well-being of those in your care at the forefront of all you do while keeping the big picture in mind. It is the ongoing pursuit of personal and professional growth as well as investing time and resources to further your learning improving your practice and in turn supporting others in their journey. Excellence is also attending to the details. ‚ÄòI take inspiration from Helen Keller who said: ‚ÄòI long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble‚Äô‚Äô‚Äù said Karen Mell principal at¬†Phoebe Gilman P.S.¬†

Education is a second career for Mell whose first permanent teaching position was in a Grade four homeroom in York Region District School Board (YRDSB). Mell decided to change careers and become an educator when she realized that her children were facing the same barriers she encountered when she was in school.¬† ‚ÄúI felt that I had to do something to impact systemic change not only for my own children but for students and families who did not have a voice so I left a successful career as a human resources manager and enrolled in teacher‚Äôs college. Taking this new direction I feel is one of the best decisions I have ever made.‚Äù she explained.¬†¬†

Having taught in the primary junior and intermediate divisions she then moved into a special education role. ‚ÄúMy passion for supporting students receiving special education services was sparked after becoming a special education resource teacher (SERT) in a community class and continued as I took on the role of coordinating SERT.¬† Mell would later go on to become a Special Education Consultant and then a Regional Performance Plus Teacher.¬† She was appointed as vice-principal in 2016 and was promoted to the role of principal in 2020.¬†¬†

It isn‚Äôt just in the classroom and in the school that Mell is making a difference.¬† She spent eight years working with the Georgina Equity and Diversity Committee (GEDAC) a group that she approached the (then) Mayor of Georgina to start as a result of a tragic hate-motivated incident in the town.

"‚ÄúEducation has opened doors for me to always be in a state of learning‚Äù explained Jaymyi Lesmond digital engagement consultant with York Region District School Board (YRDSB).¬† Lesmond has had a wide variety of experiences in education and they have helped shape how he works in his current role.¬†

Lesmond initially became interested in teaching due to the influence of his high school economics teacher.¬† ‚ÄúI appreciated his calm nature.¬† I liked that he was always available to students‚Äù Lesmond explained.¬† Lesmond eventually went on to receive degrees in economics and teaching two things he is passionate about.¬† He also enjoys discussing economics outside of the classroom.¬† ‚ÄúI love talking about cryptocurrency and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).¬† I love talking about the economy‚Äù he explained adding that he is passionate about integrating financial literacy and wealth building strategies in education to help students build the skills to navigate the economy feel empowered to manage their own financial futures and create generational wealth.¬†¬†

Lesmond began his teaching career in the private sector in the summer of 2008 including teaching at an adult learning center and private boarding school.¬† His early teaching roles shaped his approach within public education.¬† He especially recognizes the knowledge that students know if you genuinely respect and care about them and if you want them to succeed.¬† He joined YRDSB in September 2011.

While Lesmond enjoys teaching he continues to be a lifelong learner.¬† After completing his undergraduate degree he earned a Master‚Äôs of Education in Counsellor Education/School Counselling and Guidance Services.

"Milton Hart is a man who is driven by his core values values that include equity perseverance and lifelong learning. A former military officer in both Jamaica and Canada Hart‚Äôs work ethic took him to the Olympics won him multiple awards in track and lead to a successful teaching career with York Region District School Board (YRDSB).¬†¬†

While such success could be driven by a desire for personal glory this is not true of Hart. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a true believer in the idea that I wouldn‚Äôt be here had it not been for some people who took an interest in me when I was small and making my mistakes‚Äù Hart said. ‚ÄúI think my job now is to ensure the younger generation is set up for success.‚Äù This belief is reflected in his teaching coaching and commitment to championing equity. Long before he was working in schools Hart was an Infantry Soldier in the Jamaican Military.¬† He served with the Jamaican Armed Forces between 1984 and 1992. It was his time in the Jamaican Military that led him to both the Olympics and to Canada.¬†¬†

The Jamaican Bobsled team practiced on military property. Once Hart learned more about the sport and their need for strong sprinters he joined the team. He went on to compete with the team in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville France.¬†¬†

Around this time Hart also applied to become a permanent resident of Canada.¬† He chose¬†Canada because of his experience working closely with the Canadian Bobsled Team. He was also interested in¬† York University. ‚ÄúIf I ever decide to further my education I think this would be the school‚Äù he remembers thinking at the time. He said he was especially impressed by their track facilities.¬†¬†

Moving to Canada didn‚Äôt mean he was finished with military service. Once he arrived in Canada he became a Commissioned Officer and received a letter from Queen Elizabeth II a memory that he still looks back upon fondly.¬† He said the letter read ‚ÄúYou Milton Hart are allowed to lead my troops and they have a responsibility to follow you.‚Äù

"Dr. Elizabeth Sinclair has accomplished a lot in her life.¬† She‚Äôs been a teacher principal and superintendent.¬† Now she can add another title to her list of accomplishments becoming a published author.

On December 31 2021 Sinclair released¬†The Talking Kiti: Kiti Is Swahili for Chair¬†(hereafter referred to as¬†The Talking Kiti) a 42-page story that focuses on Princess Taliyah who travels through the African continent collecting objects with magical powers in order to save her family.¬†¬†

Sinclair focused on food in the story as it is ‚Äúthe first thing everyone gravitates to‚Äù when they learn about other cultures. She‚Äôs seen it in action in the classroom recalling a teachable moment where she had to encourage students to be kind and ‚Äúnot condemn it until you‚Äôve tried it.‚Äù¬† It was just another way she‚Äôs been working for what she believes in creating change and making a difference.¬†¬†

Making a difference is something Sinclair has been passionate about since she was very young.¬† Born on the Eastern Caribbean Island of St. Kitts and growing up in England she said ‚Äúmy interest has always been community involvement how can I give back to the community and make a difference?¬† I am happiest when I am giving and being of service to others to make this world a better place for everyone.‚Äù

Sinclair worked in a number of different professions before moving to teaching.¬† This included other school-related jobs such as working for an organization providing school meals in England and doing community outreach work after she relocated to Canada in 1980.¬† She is quick to point out that she did not choose teaching however teaching chose her.¬† When she was very young she would line up her dolls on the piano and play school with them. Her mother saw the spark in her as a child and encouraged her to pursue teaching.¬†¬†

Even before she was a teacher Sinclair was hard at work putting into action her plan of eventually becoming a principal.¬† She would review booklets and other materials to determine what her next steps would be in order to reach her goal.¬†

"YRDSB News and Events: Understanding Contemporary First Nations M√©tis and Inuit Voices

Beginning in 2023-2024 all students in York Region District School Board will take Understanding Contemporary First Nations M√©tis and Inuit Voices as their required Grade 11 English credit. 

The course is already being offered as an option or replacement for Grade 11 English at many secondary schools in the board.  It will be offered in all schools in 2022-2023 and will become the required Grade 11 English credit for all students in 2023-2024. 

The course is designed to expand students‚Äô understandings of Indigenous peoples cultures and contemporary realities. Learning about the history perspectives and cultures of Indigenous peoples will help students better understand Canada‚Äôs past present and potential for the future. 

‚ÄúWe are excited to be making this important change‚Äù said Heather Sears Coordinating Superintendent of Education - Curriculum and Instructional Services and Continuing Education. ‚ÄúStudents will continue to gain the important skills taught through Grade 11 English while learning more about Indigenous perspectives about Canada the importance of truth and reconciliation and the relevance of treaty relationships.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe course is a natural extension of the grade 10 history course‚Äù said Andrew McConnell Coordinator of First Nations M√©tis and Inuit education. ‚ÄúBy using contemporary works students will have a chance to see the diversity of experiences and ideas that modern Indigenous people bring to our communities today.‚Äù

Anita strives to provide students with unique and creative opportunities to share their voices and connections to various truths.

"‚ÄúFrom the start of my career I knew I wanted to be good at my job‚Äù said Phillippa Williams an Intervention Support Worker at Lake Wilcox P.S.¬† ‚ÄúMy father told me ‚Äòwhen you‚Äôre passionate about something you owe it to yourself to be great at it.‚Äô Understanding behaviour became my craft so I had to try to master it.¬† I worked in various school and clinical settings so I can have a diverse approach to challenging behaviours.‚Äù¬†¬†

Williams was born in Jamaica and moved to Canada with her family at the age of six.¬† She enrolled in the Child and Youth Worker program at George Brown College right after graduating from YRDSB‚Äôs¬†Woodbridge College¬†(Williams also attended¬†Woodbridge P.S.).¬† She now has 11 years of experience in the social services field promoting mental health and managing social and emotional needs of adolescents.¬† ‚ÄúI enjoy being an agent of change‚Äù Williams noted‚Ä¶ and an agent of change she has been.¬†¬†

When asked what advice she would offer her younger self Williams responded with ‚Äúwrite your goals in pen but your plans in pencil.‚Äù This flexibility has led her to her current role with YRDSB.¬†¬†

Now a full-time Intervention Support Worker at¬†Lake Wilcox P.S. Williams has become an integral part of the school community with her calm empathetic and equitable approach to various situations.¬†¬†

In addition to her father‚Äôs advice Williams also credits her mentors adding ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very grateful for them.‚Äù One such inspiration was a YRDSB teacher Williams had in grade 11.¬† It was the first time she‚Äôd had a Black female teacher with Caribbean heritage.¬† ‚Äú(The teacher) was unapologetic about her Caribbean background while being a master of her craft.¬† She taught me that you can be proud of who you are even in a space that looks nothing like you.¬†

"For 31 years Rose Walker has been a leader in YRDSB embodying ethical leadership and a commitment to students and staff alike.¬† While she has been demonstrating excellence she‚Äôs sure to share the credit noting she hasn‚Äôt done it alone.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI am extremely thankful that each day is filled with things I love that being my family my job and my friends‚Äù Walker explained.¬†¬†

Professionally she credits the system leaders she has worked with many of whom encouraged her to take some turns on her career path she hadn‚Äôt initially envisioned.¬† ‚ÄúI was a very content classroom teacher that found the classroom most rewarding and fulfilling.¬† I credit each leadership progression to the encouraging nudge of those leaders that I had the good fortune to work alongside.¬† With each leadership step I expanded my scope of influence on the education experience of young lives.¬† Impacting the experience of young people through their high school years is not an influence I take for granted.¬† It‚Äôs actually a heavy burden of responsibility to serve and affect young lives in the few short years they are with us‚Äù Walker explained.¬†¬†

Taking on an administrative role at YRDSB also allowed Walker to apply her graduate research and learning .¬† She completed her Master‚Äôs Degree part-time while working full-time and raising a family. Her research focused on culturally relevant and responsive pedagogy as it relates to the administrators‚Äô disciplinary practices in secondary schools .¬†¬†

Walker has been acknowledged by the school community for her ethical leadership.¬† ‚ÄúI think to operate as an ethical leader is a constant upholding of the rights and dignity of the individual.¬† It is a sincere interest in and search for the understanding of the factors that shape individuals and their behaviour and then using that information to inform my interactions.¬† That requires that we make the right decisions not the easiest ones‚Äù she explained.¬†¬†

This style of leadership is important because of the feeling of community in¬†Stouffville District Secondary School¬†(SDSS).¬†

"Janine Phillips‚Äô interests and career have taken her to the other side of the world and back; and have currently landed her at¬†Stouffville District Secondary School¬†(SDSS) where she has become an important leader for both staff and students.¬†¬†

Phillips didn‚Äôt always want to be a teacher.¬† When she was growing up she wanted to be an actress and then a child psychologist.¬† It wasn‚Äôt until her final year of high school that her guidance counsellor suggested she consider teaching.¬† It was a choice that incorporated both of her previous goals and added so much more.¬† Phillips explained that her guidance counsellor introduced her to a guest speaker at the school who was a racialized teacher from Peel District School Board.¬† ‚ÄúHe shared his experiences with me and together they convinced me that I would be a great teacher because of my love for children and passion for social justice equity and inclusion‚Äù Phillips explained.¬†¬†

Teaching has allowed Phillips to incorporate another one of her interests into her professional life; traveling.¬† For four years Phillips lived and taught in Seoul South Korea something she calls ‚Äúone of my biggest accomplishments in life.‚Äù

Currently Phillips teaches English and drama at SDSS.¬† She shares her love of literature with her students by updating her course materials to ensure the classics are being taught in a way that is relevant to her students through personal connections and current world issues.¬† She also takes the time to read new material in order to update her classes‚Äô reading material to include diverse voices and perspectives.¬†¬†

When teaching drama Phillips encourages students ‚Äúto take advantage of the freedom to create something out of nothing‚Äù which can be challenging for students who are new to the program.¬† Phillips knows that students can get overwhelmed with the pressure to be perfect; she encourages them to let go of the notion of perfection and ‚Äúgo through the creative process with an open mind.‚Äù¬† She notes that this allows them to become more confident in their decisions as a creator and present amazing work.¬†¬†

"‚ÄúIf you stay ready you don‚Äôt have to get ready‚Äù is a quote by famed actor Will Smith.¬† It‚Äôs also the notion by which¬†Bayview Secondary School¬†Principal Arlene Higgins Wright lives her life.¬†¬†

Born and raised in the GTA by her parents with her two siblings Higgins Wright spent most of her early years in a multicultural developing suburb.¬† She attended schools with classmates from a multitude of backgrounds many either first-generation Canadians or recent immigrants.¬† It was in this situation that Higgins Wright gained a genuine appreciation for differences and similarities in people‚Äôs backgrounds and experiences.¬† It was also where she developed a passion for learning that continues to serve her to this day.¬†¬†

The family relocated to York Region during Higgins Wright‚Äôs final semester of high school.¬† After completing her OSSD she entered university with the goal of becoming a criminal lawyer who helped youth in trouble with the law.¬† Due to varied experiences during her undergrad Higgins Wright discovered she‚Äôd rather work with youth before they experienced any legal challenges and turned her focus towards education.¬† A year later she had both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Education.¬† Later on she would also complete a Masters in Education.

Higgins Wright began her YRDSB journey in 1994 with a part-time role teaching science at¬†Thornlea Secondary School¬†in Thornhill.¬† It didn‚Äôt take long before she held a full-time role at the school and taught science history social science and English.¬† She held various roles on her way to her present position including: coach club staff advisor assistant department head department head curriculum consultant literacy teacher learning network co-chair member of numerous committees and vice-principal.¬†

‚ÄúEach of these experiences has deepened my understanding of systems which has enabled me to make better decisions ask better questions and engage a creative approach to develop solutions collaboratively‚Äù Higgins Wright explained.¬†¬†

"Elaine Ricketts knew from a very young age what career path she wanted to follow.¬†¬†

‚ÄúAs long as I can remember I have been in a ‚Äòteacher‚Äô role‚Äù she said noting that as far back as elementary school she was working with kindergarten students. It was then she discovered her love of working with children.¬†¬†

Ricketts was born to Jamaican immigrants and was the first person in her family to earn a degree.¬† As soon as she started working she began giving back.¬† Joining York Region District School Board (YRDSB) in 2006 Ricketts started out as a junior (grades 4-6) homeroom teacher before becoming a special education resource teacher.¬† She remembered her time working in special education fondly as she explained ‚Äúit was rewarding to watch (students with exceptionalities) grow and develop with an increased sense of confidence and self-worth.‚Äù¬†¬†

Ricketts is now a vice-principal in YRDSB splitting her time between¬†Coppard Glen Public School¬†and¬†Milliken Mills Public School.¬† Prior to her current placement she was an administrator in Elementary Virtual School North.¬† While it wasn‚Äôt a position she ever could have anticipated herself holding she looks back upon it positively noting that she gained a lot of new technical skills.¬† She also continued to prioritize connecting with students.¬† ‚ÄúBeing online I thought it was even more important to connect with students and share with them how proud I was of their work because you don‚Äôt see teachers and students walking through the hallways and I couldn‚Äôt visit classrooms the same way.¬† I felt honoured to be included in classroom activities‚Äù she said.¬† Her commitment to connectedness and togetherness is reflected in the Malcolm X quote Ricketts includes in her email signature; ‚Äúwhen ‚ÄòI‚Äô is replaced by ‚Äòwe‚Äô even illness becomes wellness.‚Äù

There are several other leadership traits that Ricketts brings with her to her job both online and in person.¬† Her nominator Karen Traynor (a former EVS teacher who now teaches at¬†Northern Lights Public School) describes her as ¬†‚Äúa voice of calm reassurance and energy to keep going.‚Äù

"Leadership takes many forms.¬† Over his 27 years with York Region District School Board Steve Gardner has demonstrated that caring and empathy is central to all of them.

‚ÄúWe talk a lot in the YRDSB about ethical leadership and Steve has been modeling this since before it was a term we as educators were made aware of‚Äù said¬†Rick Hansen P.S.¬†Teacher Jonathan Carr who started working at the school while Gardner was principal. ‚ÄúFor me I know exactly what ethical leadership looks like because I‚Äôve worked with Steve.‚Äù

Education was always of utmost importance in the Gardner family.¬† Born to Jamaican immigrants Gardner was told stories of his father working full-time and then going to school at night to achieve his goal of becoming a Management Accountant.¬† Gardner‚Äôs uncle was a teacher in Jamaica working his way up to the role of headmaster (the equivalent of being a principal in the Canadian education system).¬† His uncle used to give him and his siblings books on special occasions which Gardner said left an impression on him.¬†

Gardner started on his teaching path early working summer jobs with Toronto Parks and Recreation and local camps while growing up.¬† ‚ÄúEducation just felt like a natural fit.¬† I‚Äôve always enjoyed working with kids and seeing them develop whether in the classroom or through sports‚Äù he explained.¬†¬†

While Gardner is passionate about teaching others he is also a lifelong learner himself.¬† He was offered his first teaching contract with YRDSB just six months into his Bachelor of Education degree program.¬† While he stepped away from teaching after four years to pursue further education in his area of specialization (Educational Administration and Sport Management) he would soon return to the classroom as a teacher once again.¬†¬†¬†¬†

Gardner‚Äôs leadership was recognized when he was named the first principal of Rick Hansen P.S. in 2012. ¬† He called having the opportunity to open Rick Hansen P.S. ‚Äúthe highlight of my career.‚Äù¬† He described the staff as ‚Äúexemplary‚Äù and noted their hard work in ensuring they served the community.¬† .

"‚ÄúTrailblazer‚Äù ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù and ‚Äúbrave‚Äù are all words that have been used to describe late Somali-Canadian Journalist Hodan Nalayeh but she had another way to sum up her goal in life.¬† ‚ÄúI just want people to remember me as someone who is a unifier‚Äù she told Somali Activist Saciido Shaie.¬†

Nalayeh immigrated to Canada in the winter of 1984 along with her parents and 11 siblings.¬† The weather that greeted them was a departure from the¬†tropical climate¬†of Somalia.¬† The family arrived in Western Canada on a day when the temperatures dropped to¬†negative 40 degrees celsius.¬† The family spent their first several years in Canada in Alberta before relocating to the Greater Toronto Area in 1992.¬† Nalayeh continued her schooling in Ontario¬†graduating with a B.A. in communications from the University of Windsor.¬†¬†

Nalayeh explained on the¬†Meaningful Work Meaningful Life Podcast¬†that she experienced success on the talent side of radio broadcasting while in school however after she graduated she found herself on the advertising side.¬† She described her work after graduation as ‚Äúselling air.‚Äù¬† After the birth of her second child¬† she decided to pursue her true passion of journalism.¬†

She went back to school to refresh her knowledge in journalism and decided she wanted to work for herself rather than get another corporate job.¬† She even noted that as a child she had dreams of becoming a TV host.

Nalayeh‚Äôs sister Sahra said ‚Äúwhat I most remember about Hodan is her relentless belief in the importance of pursuing our passions and dreams.¬† She not only inspired others to pursue their dreams she was a role model.¬† She was also never afraid to speak about her challenges and share her feelings about anything.‚Äù

"Since kindergarten Tisha Nelson has known that she wanted to be a teacher. Born in Toronto but raised in Vaughan Tisha has always been driven to learn teach and lead.¬†Tisha has been¬†an educator in York Region for 11 years has been a Vice-Principal for three years and is now teaching at the Faculty of Education at York University.

Through her journey as a student turned educator and once again turned student one thing she has reflected on is that she and her siblings have had different experiences in the education system which may have led to different outcomes. Tisha recalled ‚ÄúEducation is not a one size fits all. Even though we went to the same schools we had parallel experiences.‚Äù Tisha credits some of her success to a teacher she had early on who helped her find her voice through writing. Tisha is now a published author.¬†

Beyond teaching and writing Tisha has had an affinity for leadership and is committed¬†to supporting¬†diverse learners. In 2017 Tisha was named Teacher of the Year partly due to her ability to motivate learners foster inclusion and belonging.¬† Since Tisha became a teacher 11 years ago she immediately joined the Alliance of Educators for Black Students (AEBS) an affinity group which supports Black students. Although this was not her first interaction with AEBS as she won an AEBS award as a student at Hodan Nalayeh SS (Formerly Vaughan SS) several years prior. Her¬†involvement in AEBS and in leadership stems from the desire to ‚Äúcreate¬†safer¬†spaces where students could be seen have their presence rooted. All teachers need to make students feel like they belong and that they matter and that is the first step in serving‚Äù says Tisha.

When asked what is her aspiration? Tisha responded ‚ÄúTo change the world and the way students experience schooling so that they can realize their full potential.‚Äù Tisha wants students to not be afraid to take risks to learn from their¬†failures and to¬†realize their agency and voice.

"The Right Honourable Micha√´lle Jean is never one to back away from a challenge.¬† This perseverance served her well. Jean became the first Black person to be named Governor General of Canada when she was appointed in 2005.¬† She followed this up by becoming the¬†first woman¬†to serve as the secretary-general of the¬†Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.¬† ¬†

She was born on September 6 1957 in Port-au-Prince Haiti.¬† Her father Roger was a¬†principal and teacher at a well-respected Protestant preparatory school however Jean was home-schooled so she didn‚Äôt have to swear allegiance to former leader Fran√ßois Duvalier.¬† The family fled to Canada in the¬†late 1960s and settled in Thetford Mines Quebec.¬†¬†

She pursued a Bachelor of Arts at the Universit√© de Montr√©al followed up by a Masters in Comparative Literature and further studies at the University of Perugia the University of Florence and the Catholic University of Milan. She is fluent in¬†English French Haitian Creole Italian and Spanish.¬† She can also read Portugese.¬†

Jean held¬†various roles in journalism between 1988 and 2005.¬† She worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) appearing on Radio-Canada in French and CBC Newsworld in English.¬†¬†

Jean was named the governor general of Canada in 2005 and held the role between¬†September 27 2005 and September 30 2010.¬† In her farewell message in 2010 she said in part: ‚ÄúYou are not born the governor general and commander-in-chief of Canada you answer the call of destiny with a desire to serve your fellow Canadians and invest years of your life and all your energy to become these.¬† With all of you by my side all of you who have inspired me I was able to embark on this adventure with the greatest hope and all the conviction I needed.¬† Thank you.‚Äù¬†

In December 2010 she was named¬†UNESCO‚Äôs special envoy to Haiti.¬† She held the title of chancellor at the University of Ottawa between 2012 and 2015 and was the head of the Organisation International de la Francophonie between 2015 and 2019.¬†¬†

"Long before Oscar Peterson was the namesake for a¬†YRDSB school in Stouffville he was delighting¬†audiences with his inspired piano playing.

He was¬†born in 1925¬†in Montreal to parents from St. Kitts and the British Virgin Islands and was the fourth of five children.¬† His mother was a domestic worker and his father was a boatswain who became a porter for the Canadian Pacific Railway.¬† Music was very important in the Peterson family with each child being required to learn the piano and a brass instrument.¬† Each child taught the next youngest child.¬†¬†

Peterson was a musical prodigy.¬† He won the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation‚Äôs National Music competition at the¬†age of 14 in 1940.¬† By 1945 he had recorded his first album titled¬†I Got Rhythm.¬† He was recording with artists such as¬†Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong¬†by 1956.¬† He appeared on¬†over 200 albums¬†in his career.¬† His music is still listened to today with over¬†1.1 million plays monthly on Spotify.¬†¬†

According to IMDb¬†Peterson won eight Grammy Awards in his lifetime including a lifetime achievement award in 1997. He was also awarded the Officer of the Order of Canada in 1972 and was promoted to Companion to the Order of Canada in 1984.¬†¬†

While Peterson is more well known for his musical talents he also operated the¬†Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto¬†between 1960 and 1962 before his touring commitments forced its closure.¬† Peterson held 12 honourary degrees throughout his life and was the chancellor at¬†York University from 1991 to 1994.¬† In 2010 York University launched Oscar Peterson¬†Scholarships in his honour.¬† The scholarships offered¬†$40000 as an entrance scholarship and up to four $10000 scholarships¬†for undergraduate music students.¬†¬†

In 1993¬†he suffered a stroke which hampered his ability to play the piano.¬† Undeterred he continued to play shows until 2006. In 2002 he released his autobiography¬†A Jazz Odyssey: The Life of Oscar Peterson.¬†¬†¬†In 2005 he became the first living person to be¬†commemorated on a postage stamp¬†other than a reigning monarch.¬†¬†

Sadly¬†Peterson passed away in 2007.¬† His music and legacy live on.¬†¬†#BlackExcellence #BHMyrdsb",0

Carnegie had an opportunity to¬†try out for the National Hockey League‚Äôs New York Rangers but turned it down due to lack of adequate compensation. ‚ÄúIn revisiting this experience with my father‚Äù said his daughter Bernice ‚Äúhe was clearly disappointed with their offer to the minors and the pay cut especially since he had been just voted Most Valuable Player on his team and would go on to receive this distinction for two more consecutive years.¬† In the end it should be noted that players with lesser records advanced into the NHL.‚Äù It would be several more years before Willie O‚ÄôRee would break the colour barrier in the NHL. 
Carnegie chased his dream in the¬†Quebec Professional Hockey League¬†(QPHL). He played for teams in Shawinigan Sherbrooke and Quebec City.¬† His stats remained among the league‚Äôs elite¬†posting over a point-per-game¬†(PPG) in his first seven seasons in the league.¬† In his best season he posted 127 points in just 56 games a PPG of almost 2.27. 
He also became a member of one of the most prolific lines in hockey known as the ‚ÄúBlack Aces‚Äù many years before other famous lines such as Philadelphia's ‚ÄúLegion of Doom‚Äù or Buffalo‚Äôs ‚ÄúFrench Connection‚Äù took to the ice.¬†¬†He centred his older brother Ossie and Manny McIntyre on the famous line.¬†Carnegie played one season outside the QPHL at the end of his career with the Owen Sound Mercurys of the¬†Ontario Hockey Association Senior A League¬†(OHASr). He brought his scoring touch with him collecting 55 points in 54 games.¬† He called it a career in 1954 after a single season in Owen Sound.

"Long before he was the namesake for¬†Lincoln Alexander P.S.¬†in Markham Lincoln Alexander was breaking barriers for Canadians across the country. 
A first generation Canadian Alexander was born in Toronto in 1922. His mother was from Jamaica and his father (also named Lincoln Alexander) was from St. Vincent. He served in the Royal Canadian Airforce in World War II between 1942-1945 before returning to Canada when the war was over. He marriedYvonne in 1948 and their son Keith was born one year later. 
Alexander graduated from McMaster University¬†with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1949.¬† Following this he graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School and was called to the Bar in 1953. 
He began his political career in 1965 running as a member of the Conservative Party.¬† He was narrowly defeated in his first campaign for office however he remained undeterred and was elected to his first term in 1968 at which time he became Canada‚Äôs first Black member of parliament (MP). Alexander was re-elected multiple times holding a seat until¬†1980.¬† He continued to blaze new trails while in office becoming Canada‚Äôs first Black cabinet minister in 1979 handling the Labour portfolio for Prime Minister Joe Clark until 1980.¬† He resigned his seat in 1980 when Ontario Premier Bill Davis appointed him Chair of the Ontario Workers‚Äô Compensation Board a title Alexander held for the next five years. 
He wasn‚Äôt done with politics though. Alexander became the first Black Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario in¬†1985. He was appointed to the position at the recommendation of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He held this position until 1991 when he was named Chancellor at the University of Guelph.¬† He remained chancellor at the university¬†until 2007. 
In 1992¬†he was named an officer of the Order of Ontario and a Companion to the Order of Canada. 
Five years later in¬†1997 Alexander became the Chair of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation. 
In 2006 he¬†released his memoir;¬†Go To School You‚Äôre A Little Black Boy.

"‚ÄãIf you asked the average Grade 3 student to name their favourite musicians you would likely expect to hear a myriad of popular artists.¬† This is not true of David Martin. The Buttonville P.S. student lists Vivaldi and Bach among his favourites (although he is also a big fan of Lil Nas X especially his song¬†Old Town Road). It's the music of the f‚Äãirst two though that David plays on stage. 
David has been playing the violin since he was five years old. His family was living in Jamaica at the time. David‚Äôs mother Jeneva encouraged his interest in the instrument saying she ‚Äúwas always fascinated by the violin and wanted to play it (herself).‚Äù She‚Äôs also the first to admit that she wasn‚Äôt the first person to see her son‚Äôs natural ability that person was his tutor Steven Woodham. 
Woodham is a well-known violinist from Jamaica. When he saw the gift David had for the violin he said to Jeneva ‚ÄúDavid has something really really special that I have not seen in years in a child and please please please don‚Äôt let him stop playing.‚Äù So when the Martins moved to Canada they found a new tutor (Ryan Ip) for David and his abilities have continued to grow building on his early teachings from Woodham. 
David was the youngest person in the Carribean to receive a distinction from the Associate Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) in 2018 when he completed the Grade 2 music examination at the age of six.¬† He enjoys playing music and practices about 45 minutes each day. He has performed at the North York Unionville and Newmarket Music Festivals and won his categories. 
While he enjoys using his own creativity to personalize pieces of music David‚Äôs favourite piece to play is Seitz‚Äôs¬†Concerto Note 5 Movement 3. His favourite audience? ‚ÄúMy mom my dad my uncle and my cousins.‚Äù The young violinist doesn‚Äôt feel any jealousy from his classmates over his achievements and he‚Äôs happy to help them when they need it. ‚ÄúI taught them music is not just about playing notes‚Äù David said. He added that musicians also have to count beats and play the song as it is outlined on their music sheet.

"‚ÄúGeorge look how far we‚Äôve come from 1982!‚Äù Paul Jones yelled to George Cope the now-retired executive at Bell Canada from the side of the court after game six of the NBA Finals at California‚Äôs Oakland Arena. .

It wasn‚Äôt the first time Jones and Cope had worked together in basketball; Jones coached Cope as a player at the University of Western Ontario but an NBA championship was new to both of them. Cope was there representing Bell Canada; the company has an ownership stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment the company that owns the Raptors. Jones was there doing what he‚Äôs been doing for 35 years talking basketball. .

Jones or ‚ÄúJonesy‚Äù as his friends call him has loved basketball all his life. .

Originally from Jamaica Jones moved to Canada when he was only five months old. He describes his family‚Äôs journey to Canada as one of ‚Äúinitiative.‚Äù His father had visited Canada to see his sister who was in law school at the University of Toronto and he decided to stay bringing his wife and young son up shortly after. Jones pointed out that it was ironic that his father passed on the top radio job in Jamaica to remain in Canada where both Paul and his brother Mark would become broadcasters. .

Broadcasting isn‚Äôt the only thing that runs in Jones‚Äô family. . ‚ÄúMy grandfather was a teacher and a principal in Africa and in England‚Äù he explained. Jones would eventually follow in his grandfather‚Äôs footsteps obtaining a Masters in Sports Psychology and a teaching degree at York University and the University of Western Ontario. He continued to play basketball through his undergrad playing on two all-star teams and being named a Finals MVP while at York. He also spent some time playing professionally in Europe. .

While at Western he got into coaching spending one year with the women‚Äôs team and two years with the men‚Äôs team. It was his love of coaching that brought him to teaching. Jones started as an occasional teacher with Toronto District School Board in 1984 and joined York Region District School Board (YRDSB) as a Principal in 1999. .

Lewis didn‚Äôt enter the New Media program with a goal of changing how machines think in fact she almost went into post-secondary for clarinet an instrument she played in her high school concert band.

"Dear families

ETFO has announced that beginning on January 13 2020 they will begin phase three of work-to-rule strike sanctions.

The third phase of the work-to-rule strike sanctions add to the sanctions announced in phase two in December. While previous sanctions were mostly administrative in nature during the third phase students and families will begin to notice some activities being withdrawn. 
Of note the phase 3 work-to-rule strike sanctions will mean that elementary school teachers across public schools in Ontario will: -Not participate in extra-curricular activities except for those scheduled within the school day. -Not participate in field trips. -Not arrive at school any earlier than 30 minutes before the start of the day and not stay later than 15 minutes after the end of the day. - Not participate in assemblies except to provide student supervision. 
ETFO also announced phase four strike sanctions effective January 20. In phase four ETFO has announced that teachers will participate in rotating one-day strikes if a deal is not reached. We do not yet have details on the timing of the rotating strike which will impact schools at the York Region District School Board and will provide information as early as possible. The full list of sanctions by ETFO is available on the Board‚Äôs website. 
We know this is disappointing for students and families.¬† Your child‚Äôs school will provide additional information regarding extra-curricular activities events and field trips that may have to be cancelled as a result of this work-to-rule strike action. 
Student safety continues to be our priority and we continue to make contingency plans and work to minimize the impact of labour sanctions on students.
