Over the past four years Charlotte Clementine has been writing and performing music and has already released three singles as well as a new three-song EP “Depths of the Sea” which was released in January. Charlotte wrote the lyrics of the final song “Rising” to express the feelings of freedom and relief after the end of a difficult friendship. “The song is about finally gaining a true voice and no longer having to feel small” she says. She had the opportunity to perform “Rising” at Yonge-Dundas Square in July 2023 as part of YOUTH Day Global.

In addition to being a songwriter and recording artist Charlotte can also call herself an award-winning singer actress playwright and director.
 

Charlotte received five golds at the 2023 Newmarket Voice Festival and after that success went on to win the Speech Arts category at the Ontario Musical Festivals Association provincials and was also a finalist in both musical theatre and classical singing.

To date Charlotte has been in more than 25 musical theatre productions and is set to play a mersister in Marquee’s adult cast of The Little Mermaid in April 2024.
 

You can also find Charlotte on TV! In her short career she has starred in two commercials and has also been featured in two short films.

She spent the past two summers writing and directing her first play and musical as part of Newmarket’s Very Useful Theatre Company’s youth company.

"On November 8 York Region District School Board experienced a cyber incident resulting in a network outage. The vast majority of school-related systems were restored quickly and classroom education continued without much disruption. 

 

Since the outset the Board has worked with third party legal and technology experts to ensure an appropriate and effective response. We have also engaged law enforcement.

 

Regrettably we have now confirmed that data was taken by those who compromised our network.  It will take time to analyze the data and determine who is affected and how. The current analysis indicates that the greatest potential risk of exposure is to a limited number of our current employees. While students and parents may also be affected their potential exposure is limited. The school based online payment system “SchoolCash Online” Edsby Teach Assist and student information systems were not affected by this incident and data collected and stored in those systems continues to be secure. 

 

We understand that you want to know whether you are affected by this incident. We are  analyzing data however this process is time consuming. We will notify families directly if we identify a potential risk. In the interim we will continue to be transparent with the public as we work through our recovery process. 

 

There is a webpage on the board website that will continue to be updated with frequently asked questions for members of the public. 

 

We appreciate that this news is concerning and we regret this has occurred. We are committed to learning from this incident and making improvements to our network security that will best protect our students and families.

"The Huron Heights SS junior and senior football teams made history multiple times this year.

At the 2023 OFSAA Golden Horseshoe Bowl the senior Warriors faced off against the number two team in Ontario Halton Catholic School Board’s Corpus Christi Longhorns. In what was billed as the game of the week the Warriors won a commanding victory with a final score of 37-2. After an incredible 12-1 season record the senior Warriors were named Provincial and National champions. Over the past three years the Warriors have been the number one team in the nation twice.

One team member made history by becoming the first female student in YRDSB to win an OFSAA football championship. Defensive back and wide receiver Chloe Winterton helped lead her team to victory on the field and scored a win toward gender inclusivity in a traditionally male-dominated sport. As a board we are incredibly proud of her for blazing trail and helping to change preconceived notions about the sport.

The junior Warriors also had a banner victory at the 2023 Junior Metro Bowl. The younger Warriors took on Peterborough’s Holy Cross Catholic School and won a definitive victory with a final score of 42-3.

It was an honour to serve this community as your Director and I feel very optimistic about the future because of the people who make up YRDSB.

With summer school at an end Pierre Berton Resource Library has stepped up to continue supporting this initiative. Through the collaboration with @VaughanPublicLibraries students can know they can access snacks in the youth area at Pierre Berton Resource Library whenever the library is open.

"Mno Anishinaabe Giizhigad (Happy Anishinaabe Day).

Today we recognize the second national observance of Anishinaabe Giizhigad which is a celebration specific to the @anishinabeknation.

Here's a little more background about the day. https://youtu.be/7mwGnf1klIk

Our social media team had the honour of attending a celebration @yrdsb_sdhs led by Ms. Johnston who teaches the Ojibwe language class.

Students learned about Indigenous innovations and matched up contemporary versions to their Indigenous inspired counterparts. 

Students were also able to scan QR codes to learn more information about the innovations and their names in Anishinaabemowin. Anishinaabemowin is how you say Ojibwe in the language. 

We'll be sharing some of these Indigenous innovations throughout the month and invite our followers to learn alongside us.

"YRDSB News And Events: Land Acknowledgement 

A diverse group of students are filming multiple versions of the Land Acknowledgment which will include English French and American Sign Language (ASL) to ensure accessibility for our schools within the York Region District School Board. 

The project originated from a request by a specialist teacher for an ASL version to cater to deaf and hard-of-hearing students. As a community we must emphasize the importance of inclusivity understanding and respect for Indigenous communities highlighting the value of caring for the land and waters. 

These 3 versions of the Land Acknowledgement will be available next year for our schools.

I am passionate about helping students grow by developing their short term and long term educational needs and goals. I came to this country as an immigrant and I had wonderful teachers who provided support guidance and empowerment. This support has helped to mild the person I am today.

"Please take a few moments to read this message from Director Yake regarding supporting the YRDSB 2SLGBTQIA+ community. 

As a school board we support the use of social media platforms when used as effective and respectful teaching learning and communications tools. I applaud the 1000’s of staff students and community members that do just that on a regular basis. However recently and far too often we are seeing incidents of hate threats and bullying in various ways and on various platforms. This is both concerning and totally unacceptable. It is for this reason the ‘comments’ feature on the Board’s Twitter account was turned off in November 2022. This small measure was to shield our students staff and families from unnecessary and unacceptable hate hurt and harm. 

It is both concerning and heartbreaking when we see comments of this nature at any time but especially on posts that are meant to celebrate give visibility be identity-affirming and show support to our diverse and marginalized communities. This week for example targeted and offensive threats have occurred directed towards the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. This is a community that has unfortunately seen a recent increase in incidents of hate both online and in person including a hateful “protest” at one of our elementary schools. It deeply saddens me that the 2SLGBTQIA+ community have been targeted in this way and I know our senior team share these feelings. We stand with our community and remain committed to ensuring all of our students feel safe welcome seen and celebrated in our schools and workplaces. This includes our students staff and families who identify as 2SLGBTQIA+. These recent incidents have been addressed and the targeting of marginalized communities will not be tolerated at our Board. 

We will continue to unapologetically celebrate and affirm the diverse identities of our students staff and community members throughout YRDSB. Hateful comments will not deter us from doing what is in the best interest of our communities and I applaud all who continue to promote equity diversity and inclusion across our Board.

"Our next submission comes to us from Superintendent of Education Steven Gardner!
 

Education was always of utmost importance in the Gardner family.  Born to Jamaican immigrants Steve lived in Jamaica for part of his early primary years. Steve’s uncle was a teacher in Jamaica working his way up to the role of headmaster (the equivalent of being a principal in the Canadian education system).  His uncle used to give him and his siblings books on special occasions which Steve said left a lasting impression on him. “The gift of a book is something I still hold close”.

 

Steve’s entire education career has been with the YRDSB.  He began as an elementary teacher over 28 years ago and over the course of those years he has held  numerous roles including Vice Principal School Principal Centrally Assigned Principal and currently Superintendent of Schools. 

 

Steve encourages educators to get to know their students and let them know that they are invested in their success and their struggles – and ensuring actions are aligned with words.

"Our first submission for Celebrating Black Excellence - Black Voices comes from our Associate Director of Education Equitable Outcomes and Schools Cecil Roach!

In this video Mr. Roach shares an important Canadian history lesson that is also part of his own personal history. 

During his long career as a teacher vice principal principal superintendent and now Associate Director Mr. Cecil Roach has always maintained that he has had the opportunity to have a very profound impact on the lives of young people.

He is the proud son of the recently deceased Mary Roach a West Indian Domestic. Mary was one of 5000 West Indian women who between 1955 and 1964 came to Canada on the West Indian Domestic Scheme.

Arriving in Canada in his early teens Mr. Roach completed most of his schooling in Montreal and holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from Concordia and McGill Universities. He maintains that his time as one who has been termed the “barrel children” (children whose parents left them behind with a grandparent while they prepare for their reunion in Canada) has given him a special insight into the dynamics of immigration and its impact on student achievement and well- being. This experience has also strengthened Mr. Roach’s belief that schools are places where all students must be given the opportunity to expand their dreams on their journey towards full participation in Canadian society.

"In honour of #SolidarityWeek we've asked some of our staff to answer a few questions about solidarity and allyship.

 

Here's Jordan from the curriculum math team sharing how we can centre community voice in classrooms and schools. 

 

Jordan’s passion for mathematics education was sparked once he had kids of his own leading to a profound interest in the development of student thinking and reasoning. His practice is guided by the roles identity community and storytelling have in uncovering a sense of wonder belief and belonging for all especially students and communities who have and continue to face oppression. He believes when we value and honor the experiences we all have we nurture learning spaces that provide greater access for all learners to take part in meaningful rich and intellectually engaging mathematics. What emerges from here are classrooms and schools rooted in solidarity and allyship nurtured through the growth and success of the collective. Jordan spent 17 years as a classroom teacher and currently works as a Regional Mathematics Facilitator providing professional learning and in-class support for educators in the York Region District School Board in Ontario Canada. He writes problem-based units with the Make Math Moments community serves on the Research and Advocacy Committee with the Coalition for Alternatives to Streaming in Education (CASE) and speaks at local national and international conferences on a variety of topics such as Thinking Flexibly to Develop Fluency Teaching Through Problems Worth Solving and Disrupting Special Education Structures: Supporting De-Streaming in Elementary Mathematics.",0

"“Excellence is placing the needs and well-being of those in your care at the forefront of all you do while keeping the big picture in mind. It is the ongoing pursuit of personal and professional growth as well as investing time and resources to further your learning improving your practice and in turn supporting others in their journey. Excellence is also attending to the details. ‘I take inspiration from Helen Keller who said: ‘I long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble’’” said Karen Mell principal at Phoebe Gilman P.S. 

Education is a second career for Mell whose first permanent teaching position was in a Grade four homeroom in York Region District School Board (YRDSB). Mell decided to change careers and become an educator when she realized that her children were facing the same barriers she encountered when she was in school.  “I felt that I had to do something to impact systemic change not only for my own children but for students and families who did not have a voice so I left a successful career as a human resources manager and enrolled in teacher’s college. Taking this new direction I feel is one of the best decisions I have ever made.” she explained.  

Having taught in the primary junior and intermediate divisions she then moved into a special education role. “My passion for supporting students receiving special education services was sparked after becoming a special education resource teacher (SERT) in a community class and continued as I took on the role of coordinating SERT.  Mell would later go on to become a Special Education Consultant and then a Regional Performance Plus Teacher.  She was appointed as vice-principal in 2016 and was promoted to the role of principal in 2020.  

It isn’t just in the classroom and in the school that Mell is making a difference.  She spent eight years working with the Georgina Equity and Diversity Committee (GEDAC) a group that she approached the (then) Mayor of Georgina to start as a result of a tragic hate-motivated incident in the town.

"“Education has opened doors for me to always be in a state of learning” explained Jaymyi Lesmond digital engagement consultant with York Region District School Board (YRDSB).  Lesmond has had a wide variety of experiences in education and they have helped shape how he works in his current role. 

Lesmond initially became interested in teaching due to the influence of his high school economics teacher.  “I appreciated his calm nature.  I liked that he was always available to students” Lesmond explained.  Lesmond eventually went on to receive degrees in economics and teaching two things he is passionate about.  He also enjoys discussing economics outside of the classroom.  “I love talking about cryptocurrency and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).  I love talking about the economy” he explained adding that he is passionate about integrating financial literacy and wealth building strategies in education to help students build the skills to navigate the economy feel empowered to manage their own financial futures and create generational wealth.  

Lesmond began his teaching career in the private sector in the summer of 2008 including teaching at an adult learning center and private boarding school.  His early teaching roles shaped his approach within public education.  He especially recognizes the knowledge that students know if you genuinely respect and care about them and if you want them to succeed.  He joined YRDSB in September 2011.

In his current role Lesmond works with a variety of digital engagement tools supporting educators students and families.  He works on the school board’s digital literacy team and supports cohesion among digital tools to better serve every stakeholder.  He also understands that some tools may not be equally accessible and equitable to every student and/or family and is working on supporting other staff in this understanding as well.  

While Lesmond enjoys teaching he continues to be a lifelong learner.  After completing his undergraduate degree he earned a Master’s of Education in Counsellor Education/School Counselling and Guidance Services.

"Milton Hart is a man who is driven by his core values values that include equity perseverance and lifelong learning. A former military officer in both Jamaica and Canada Hart’s work ethic took him to the Olympics won him multiple awards in track and lead to a successful teaching career with York Region District School Board (YRDSB).  

While such success could be driven by a desire for personal glory this is not true of Hart. “I’m a true believer in the idea that I wouldn’t be here had it not been for some people who took an interest in me when I was small and making my mistakes” Hart said. “I think my job now is to ensure the younger generation is set up for success.” This belief is reflected in his teaching coaching and commitment to championing equity. Long before he was working in schools Hart was an Infantry Soldier in the Jamaican Military.  He served with the Jamaican Armed Forces between 1984 and 1992. It was his time in the Jamaican Military that led him to both the Olympics and to Canada.  

The Jamaican Bobsled team practiced on military property. Once Hart learned more about the sport and their need for strong sprinters he joined the team. He went on to compete with the team in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville France.  

Around this time Hart also applied to become a permanent resident of Canada.  He chose Canada because of his experience working closely with the Canadian Bobsled Team. He was also interested in  York University. “If I ever decide to further my education I think this would be the school” he remembers thinking at the time. He said he was especially impressed by their track facilities.  

Moving to Canada didn’t mean he was finished with military service. Once he arrived in Canada he became a Commissioned Officer and received a letter from Queen Elizabeth II a memory that he still looks back upon fondly.  He said the letter read “You Milton Hart are allowed to lead my troops and they have a responsibility to follow you.”

"Dr. Elizabeth Sinclair has accomplished a lot in her life.  She’s been a teacher principal and superintendent.  Now she can add another title to her list of accomplishments becoming a published author.

On December 31 2021 Sinclair released The Talking Kiti: Kiti Is Swahili for Chair (hereafter referred to as The Talking Kiti) a 42-page story that focuses on Princess Taliyah who travels through the African continent collecting objects with magical powers in order to save her family.  

Sinclair focused on food in the story as it is “the first thing everyone gravitates to” when they learn about other cultures. She’s seen it in action in the classroom recalling a teachable moment where she had to encourage students to be kind and “not condemn it until you’ve tried it.”  It was just another way she’s been working for what she believes in creating change and making a difference.  

Making a difference is something Sinclair has been passionate about since she was very young.  Born on the Eastern Caribbean Island of St. Kitts and growing up in England she said “my interest has always been community involvement how can I give back to the community and make a difference?  I am happiest when I am giving and being of service to others to make this world a better place for everyone.”

Sinclair worked in a number of different professions before moving to teaching.  This included other school-related jobs such as working for an organization providing school meals in England and doing community outreach work after she relocated to Canada in 1980.  She is quick to point out that she did not choose teaching however teaching chose her.  When she was very young she would line up her dolls on the piano and play school with them. Her mother saw the spark in her as a child and encouraged her to pursue teaching.  

Even before she was a teacher Sinclair was hard at work putting into action her plan of eventually becoming a principal.  She would review booklets and other materials to determine what her next steps would be in order to reach her goal.

"YRDSB News and Events: Understanding Contemporary First Nations Métis and Inuit Voices

Beginning in 2023-2024 all students in York Region District School Board will take Understanding Contemporary First Nations Métis and Inuit Voices as their required Grade 11 English credit. 

The course is already being offered as an option or replacement for Grade 11 English at many secondary schools in the board.  It will be offered in all schools in 2022-2023 and will become the required Grade 11 English credit for all students in 2023-2024. 

The course is designed to expand students’ understandings of Indigenous peoples cultures and contemporary realities. Learning about the history perspectives and cultures of Indigenous peoples will help students better understand Canada’s past present and potential for the future. 

“We are excited to be making this important change” said Heather Sears Coordinating Superintendent of Education - Curriculum and Instructional Services and Continuing Education. “Students will continue to gain the important skills taught through Grade 11 English while learning more about Indigenous perspectives about Canada the importance of truth and reconciliation and the relevance of treaty relationships.”

“The course is a natural extension of the grade 10 history course” said Andrew McConnell Coordinator of First Nations Métis and Inuit education. “By using contemporary works students will have a chance to see the diversity of experiences and ideas that modern Indigenous people bring to our communities today.”

"“From the start of my career I knew I wanted to be good at my job” said Phillippa Williams an Intervention Support Worker at Lake Wilcox P.S.  “My father told me ‘when you’re passionate about something you owe it to yourself to be great at it.’ Understanding behaviour became my craft so I had to try to master it.  I worked in various school and clinical settings so I can have a diverse approach to challenging behaviours.”  

Williams was born in Jamaica and moved to Canada with her family at the age of six.  She enrolled in the Child and Youth Worker program at George Brown College right after graduating from YRDSB’s Woodbridge College (Williams also attended Woodbridge P.S.).  She now has 11 years of experience in the social services field promoting mental health and managing social and emotional needs of adolescents.  “I enjoy being an agent of change” Williams noted… and an agent of change she has been.  

When asked what advice she would offer her younger self Williams responded with “write your goals in pen but your plans in pencil.” This flexibility has led her to her current role with YRDSB.  

Now a full-time Intervention Support Worker at Lake Wilcox P.S. Williams has become an integral part of the school community with her calm empathetic and equitable approach to various situations.  

“Phillippa is an advocate for students.  She is willing to address barriers and dismantle them so she can provide an environment where all students can succeed.  She sees the best in every child” said former Lindsey Diakiw principal  Leadership Development and Engagement and previously Lake Wilcox P.S. principal  

In addition to her father’s advice Williams also credits her mentors adding “I’m very grateful for them.” One such inspiration was a YRDSB teacher Williams had in grade 11.  It was the first time she’d had a Black female teacher with Caribbean heritage.  “(The teacher) was unapologetic about her Caribbean background while being a master of her craft.  She taught me that you can be proud of who you are even in a space that looks nothing like you.

"For 31 years Rose Walker has been a leader in YRDSB embodying ethical leadership and a commitment to students and staff alike.  While she has been demonstrating excellence she’s sure to share the credit noting she hasn’t done it alone.  

“I am extremely thankful that each day is filled with things I love that being my family my job and my friends” Walker explained.  

Professionally she credits the system leaders she has worked with many of whom encouraged her to take some turns on her career path she hadn’t initially envisioned.  “I was a very content classroom teacher that found the classroom most rewarding and fulfilling.  I credit each leadership progression to the encouraging nudge of those leaders that I had the good fortune to work alongside.  With each leadership step I expanded my scope of influence on the education experience of young lives.  Impacting the experience of young people through their high school years is not an influence I take for granted.  It’s actually a heavy burden of responsibility to serve and affect young lives in the few short years they are with us” Walker explained.  

Taking on an administrative role at YRDSB also allowed Walker to apply her graduate research and learning .  She completed her Master’s Degree part-time while working full-time and raising a family. Her research focused on culturally relevant and responsive pedagogy as it relates to the administrators’ disciplinary practices in secondary schools .  

Walker has been acknowledged by the school community for her ethical leadership.  “I think to operate as an ethical leader is a constant upholding of the rights and dignity of the individual.  It is a sincere interest in and search for the understanding of the factors that shape individuals and their behaviour and then using that information to inform my interactions.  That requires that we make the right decisions not the easiest ones” she explained.  

This style of leadership is important because of the feeling of community in Stouffville District Secondary School (SDSS).

"Janine Phillips’ interests and career have taken her to the other side of the world and back; and have currently landed her at Stouffville District Secondary School (SDSS) where she has become an important leader for both staff and students.  

Phillips didn’t always want to be a teacher.  When she was growing up she wanted to be an actress and then a child psychologist.  It wasn’t until her final year of high school that her guidance counsellor suggested she consider teaching.  It was a choice that incorporated both of her previous goals and added so much more.  Phillips explained that her guidance counsellor introduced her to a guest speaker at the school who was a racialized teacher from Peel District School Board.  “He shared his experiences with me and together they convinced me that I would be a great teacher because of my love for children and passion for social justice equity and inclusion” Phillips explained.  

Teaching has allowed Phillips to incorporate another one of her interests into her professional life; traveling.  For four years Phillips lived and taught in Seoul South Korea something she calls “one of my biggest accomplishments in life.”

Currently Phillips teaches English and drama at SDSS.  She shares her love of literature with her students by updating her course materials to ensure the classics are being taught in a way that is relevant to her students through personal connections and current world issues.  She also takes the time to read new material in order to update her classes’ reading material to include diverse voices and perspectives.  

When teaching drama Phillips encourages students “to take advantage of the freedom to create something out of nothing” which can be challenging for students who are new to the program.  Phillips knows that students can get overwhelmed with the pressure to be perfect; she encourages them to let go of the notion of perfection and “go through the creative process with an open mind.”  She notes that this allows them to become more confident in their decisions as a creator and present amazing work.

"“If you stay ready you don’t have to get ready” is a quote by famed actor Will Smith.  It’s also the notion by which Bayview Secondary School Principal Arlene Higgins Wright lives her life.  

Born and raised in the GTA by her parents with her two siblings Higgins Wright spent most of her early years in a multicultural developing suburb.  She attended schools with classmates from a multitude of backgrounds many either first-generation Canadians or recent immigrants.  It was in this situation that Higgins Wright gained a genuine appreciation for differences and similarities in people’s backgrounds and experiences.  It was also where she developed a passion for learning that continues to serve her to this day.  

The family relocated to York Region during Higgins Wright’s final semester of high school.  After completing her OSSD she entered university with the goal of becoming a criminal lawyer who helped youth in trouble with the law.  Due to varied experiences during her undergrad Higgins Wright discovered she’d rather work with youth before they experienced any legal challenges and turned her focus towards education.  A year later she had both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Education.  Later on she would also complete a Masters in Education.

Higgins Wright began her YRDSB journey in 1994 with a part-time role teaching science at Thornlea Secondary School in Thornhill.  It didn’t take long before she held a full-time role at the school and taught science history social science and English.  She held various roles on her way to her present position including: coach club staff advisor assistant department head department head curriculum consultant literacy teacher learning network co-chair member of numerous committees and vice-principal. 

“Each of these experiences has deepened my understanding of systems which has enabled me to make better decisions ask better questions and engage a creative approach to develop solutions collaboratively” Higgins Wright explained.

"Elaine Ricketts knew from a very young age what career path she wanted to follow.  

“As long as I can remember I have been in a ‘teacher’ role” she said noting that as far back as elementary school she was working with kindergarten students. It was then she discovered her love of working with children.  

Ricketts was born to Jamaican immigrants and was the first person in her family to earn a degree.  As soon as she started working she began giving back.  Joining York Region District School Board (YRDSB) in 2006 Ricketts started out as a junior (grades 4-6) homeroom teacher before becoming a special education resource teacher.  She remembered her time working in special education fondly as she explained “it was rewarding to watch (students with exceptionalities) grow and develop with an increased sense of confidence and self-worth.”  

Ricketts is now a vice-principal in YRDSB splitting her time between Coppard Glen Public School and Milliken Mills Public School.  Prior to her current placement she was an administrator in Elementary Virtual School North.  While it wasn’t a position she ever could have anticipated herself holding she looks back upon it positively noting that she gained a lot of new technical skills.  She also continued to prioritize connecting with students.  “Being online I thought it was even more important to connect with students and share with them how proud I was of their work because you don’t see teachers and students walking through the hallways and I couldn’t visit classrooms the same way.  I felt honoured to be included in classroom activities” she said.  Her commitment to connectedness and togetherness is reflected in the Malcolm X quote Ricketts includes in her email signature; “when ‘I’ is replaced by ‘we’ even illness becomes wellness.”

There are several other leadership traits that Ricketts brings with her to her job both online and in person.  Her nominator Karen Traynor (a former EVS teacher who now teaches at Northern Lights Public School) describes her as  “a voice of calm reassurance and energy to keep going.”

As part of the community at Adrienne Clarkson Public School Bryan has been described as a “role model” and had her work on supporting Black excellence described as “beyond exceptional.”  She describes her views on this work by saying “I’m a Black woman who lives every day in this Black skin.  In this Black body lies so much learning culture knowledge and experience that has molded me into the person I am.  I come from a community that has experienced so much trauma but yet has such a rich influence on society.”  Bryan added that when she goes out into the world she’s motivated by all of the accomplishments that Black people have made including her family immigrating from Jamaica to Canada and Barack Obama being elected as the first Black President of the United States. “These are just a fraction of the accomplishments that represent Black Excellence to me.  It goes beyond just one month.  It should be honoured 365 days a year and beyond” she explained.

"Leadership takes many forms.  Over his 27 years with York Region District School Board Steve Gardner has demonstrated that caring and empathy is central to all of them.

“We talk a lot in the YRDSB about ethical leadership and Steve has been modeling this since before it was a term we as educators were made aware of” said Rick Hansen P.S. Teacher Jonathan Carr who started working at the school while Gardner was principal. “For me I know exactly what ethical leadership looks like because I’ve worked with Steve.”

Education was always of utmost importance in the Gardner family.  Born to Jamaican immigrants Gardner was told stories of his father working full-time and then going to school at night to achieve his goal of becoming a Management Accountant.  Gardner’s uncle was a teacher in Jamaica working his way up to the role of headmaster (the equivalent of being a principal in the Canadian education system).  His uncle used to give him and his siblings books on special occasions which Gardner said left an impression on him. 

Gardner started on his teaching path early working summer jobs with Toronto Parks and Recreation and local camps while growing up.  “Education just felt like a natural fit.  I’ve always enjoyed working with kids and seeing them develop whether in the classroom or through sports” he explained.  

While Gardner is passionate about teaching others he is also a lifelong learner himself.  He was offered his first teaching contract with YRDSB just six months into his Bachelor of Education degree program.  While he stepped away from teaching after four years to pursue further education in his area of specialization (Educational Administration and Sport Management) he would soon return to the classroom as a teacher once again.    

Gardner’s leadership was recognized when he was named the first principal of Rick Hansen P.S. in 2012.   He called having the opportunity to open Rick Hansen P.S. “the highlight of my career.”  He described the staff as “exemplary” and noted their hard work in ensuring they served the community.  .

"“Trailblazer” “inspirational” and “brave” are all words that have been used to describe late Somali-Canadian Journalist Hodan Nalayeh but she had another way to sum up her goal in life.  “I just want people to remember me as someone who is a unifier” she told Somali Activist Saciido Shaie. 

Nalayeh immigrated to Canada in the winter of 1984 along with her parents and 11 siblings.  The weather that greeted them was a departure from the tropical climate of Somalia.  The family arrived in Western Canada on a day when the temperatures dropped to negative 40 degrees celsius.  The family spent their first several years in Canada in Alberta before relocating to the Greater Toronto Area in 1992.  Nalayeh continued her schooling in Ontario graduating with a B.A. in communications from the University of Windsor.  

Nalayeh explained on the Meaningful Work Meaningful Life Podcast that she experienced success on the talent side of radio broadcasting while in school however after she graduated she found herself on the advertising side.  She described her work after graduation as “selling air.”  After the birth of her second child  she decided to pursue her true passion of journalism. 

She went back to school to refresh her knowledge in journalism and decided she wanted to work for herself rather than get another corporate job.  She even noted that as a child she had dreams of becoming a TV host.

Nalayeh’s sister Sahra said “what I most remember about Hodan is her relentless belief in the importance of pursuing our passions and dreams.  She not only inspired others to pursue their dreams she was a role model.  She was also never afraid to speak about her challenges and share her feelings about anything.”

She founded IntegrationTV originally airing on OMNI TV before moving to YouTube.  IntegrationTV is a channel that’s description reads “Uplifting & Inspiring Somali Stories!  Connecting Somalis worldwide.  Changing our narrative.”  Since the channel was founded on YouTube on February 15 2014 it has garnered 90000 subscribers and over 10 million total views.  The movement also has over 132000 followers on Facebook.

"Earlier this month York Region District School Board hosted its first conference for Muslim students. 

The three-day virtual conference PILLARS to Well-Being took place March 2-4 and focused on mental health and well-being along with affirming Muslim identity. Students had the opportunity to hear from keynote speakers Mohamad Fakih Jamilah Thompkins-Bigelow and Uzma Jalaluddin. Students chose from a variety of workshops that covered topics related to various aspects of well-being from nutrition arts breath physical activity and mental health to human rights and challenging Islamophobia. 

""The PILLARS Conference was amazing a great opportunity to learn play and grow with other Muslim staff and students. Can't wait to attend and see what the next conference will be like!"" said Rida Ali a student at Alexander Mackenzie H.S.

“I was very fortunate to be able to attend this conference it really showed me that the school board is willing to provide these important opportunities to the Muslim student community” said Riyad Rahim a student at Sutton District H.S.

“It was a monumental event that let our Muslim students know that they are valued heard and important” said Wahid Khan South Asian Teacher Liaison with YRDSB and one of the conference organizers. 

The conference was organized by the Alliance of Educators for Muslim Students (AEMS) with the support of York Region District School Board’s Inclusive School and Community Services. 

“We are so grateful to our AEMS team members who brought this together our community partners who joined us and ISCS and colleagues who supported us.  We are also very touched by the responses from students families and both Muslim and non-Muslim staff about the impact that this event has had on them” said Rizwana Kaderdina Equity Teacher Facilitator with YRDSB and another of the conference organizers.

"Since kindergarten Tisha Nelson has known that she wanted to be a teacher. Born in Toronto but raised in Vaughan Tisha has always been driven to learn teach and lead. Tisha has been an educator in York Region for 11 years has been a Vice-Principal for three years and is now teaching at the Faculty of Education at York University.

Through her journey as a student turned educator and once again turned student one thing she has reflected on is that she and her siblings have had different experiences in the education system which may have led to different outcomes. Tisha recalled “Education is not a one size fits all. Even though we went to the same schools we had parallel experiences.” Tisha credits some of her success to a teacher she had early on who helped her find her voice through writing. Tisha is now a published author. 

Beyond teaching and writing Tisha has had an affinity for leadership and is committed to supporting diverse learners. In 2017 Tisha was named Teacher of the Year partly due to her ability to motivate learners foster inclusion and belonging.  Since Tisha became a teacher 11 years ago she immediately joined the Alliance of Educators for Black Students (AEBS) an affinity group which supports Black students. Although this was not her first interaction with AEBS as she won an AEBS award as a student at Hodan Nalayeh SS (Formerly Vaughan SS) several years prior. Her involvement in AEBS and in leadership stems from the desire to “create safer spaces where students could be seen have their presence rooted. All teachers need to make students feel like they belong and that they matter and that is the first step in serving” says Tisha.

When asked what is her aspiration? Tisha responded “To change the world and the way students experience schooling so that they can realize their full potential.” Tisha wants students to not be afraid to take risks to learn from their failures and to realize their agency and voice.

"Dictionary.com defines excellence as the fact or state of excelling.  At the age of 15 Newmarket High School’s Fola Olusanya is living this definition as he writes his own story.  

Coming from a family of Nigerian immigrants Olusanya credits his parents and friends with motivating and empowering him to maintain his high grades in school.  Described by Newmarket H.S. Teacher Deneena Davis as a “strong academic” Olusanya has aspirations of attending medical school after graduation something he notes is a very competitive program.  Olusanya enjoys many subjects specifically history English French and science.  He’s not letting the pandemic put a damper on his school experience either noting “I have been able to stay upbeat about learning because I know that focusing now will help me out in the next few years.”

While remaining committed to his studies Olusanya is also very involved in other aspects of his schooling and with his community.  He serves as a junior representative for Grade 10 students on the Newmarket HS student council.  In this role he ensures the ideas and issues of the wider school community are heard and (if possible) acted on.  In the future he’d like to see tools such as Instagram and Google Forms used to streamline the communication of ideas between students and their representatives.  

His advocacy doesn’t stop at the front door of Newmarket H.S.  Olusanya is a member of YRDSB’s Regional Student Equity Committee and a student liaison for YRDSB’s Anti-Black Racism Steering Committee.  After being invited to become involved with both groups by different YRDSB staff the tenth grader became a strong voice on how to make school environments more inclusive and assisted with organizing a student-led conference where he delivered a speech on working together and amplifying the voices of others to spur positive change in local schools.  

In another example of demonstrated leadership Olusanya serves as treasurer of the Newmarket Youth Leadership Group a group working to empower youth and create more youth-driven opportunities and activities.

"The Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean is never one to back away from a challenge.  This perseverance served her well. Jean became the first Black person to be named Governor General of Canada when she was appointed in 2005.  She followed this up by becoming the first woman to serve as the secretary-general of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.   

She was born on September 6 1957 in Port-au-Prince Haiti.  Her father Roger was a principal and teacher at a well-respected Protestant preparatory school however Jean was home-schooled so she didn’t have to swear allegiance to former leader François Duvalier.  The family fled to Canada in the late 1960s and settled in Thetford Mines Quebec.  

She pursued a Bachelor of Arts at the Université de Montréal followed up by a Masters in Comparative Literature and further studies at the University of Perugia the University of Florence and the Catholic University of Milan. She is fluent in English French Haitian Creole Italian and Spanish.  She can also read Portugese. 

Jean held various roles in journalism between 1988 and 2005.  She worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) appearing on Radio-Canada in French and CBC Newsworld in English.  

Jean was named the governor general of Canada in 2005 and held the role between September 27 2005 and September 30 2010.  In her farewell message in 2010 she said in part: “You are not born the governor general and commander-in-chief of Canada you answer the call of destiny with a desire to serve your fellow Canadians and invest years of your life and all your energy to become these.  With all of you by my side all of you who have inspired me I was able to embark on this adventure with the greatest hope and all the conviction I needed.  Thank you.” 

In December 2010 she was named UNESCO’s special envoy to Haiti.  She held the title of chancellor at the University of Ottawa between 2012 and 2015 and was the head of the Organisation International de la Francophonie between 2015 and 2019.  

Jean is married to Jean-Daniel Lafond.  Together they have a daughter named Marie-Eden.

"Long before Oscar Peterson was the namesake for a YRDSB school in Stouffville he was delighting audiences with his inspired piano playing.

He was born in 1925 in Montreal to parents from St. Kitts and the British Virgin Islands and was the fourth of five children.  His mother was a domestic worker and his father was a boatswain who became a porter for the Canadian Pacific Railway.  Music was very important in the Peterson family with each child being required to learn the piano and a brass instrument.  Each child taught the next youngest child.  

Peterson was a musical prodigy.  He won the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s National Music competition at the age of 14 in 1940.  By 1945 he had recorded his first album titled I Got Rhythm.  He was recording with artists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong by 1956.  He appeared on over 200 albums in his career.  His music is still listened to today with over 1.1 million plays monthly on Spotify.  

According to IMDb Peterson won eight Grammy Awards in his lifetime including a lifetime achievement award in 1997. He was also awarded the Officer of the Order of Canada in 1972 and was promoted to Companion to the Order of Canada in 1984.  

While Peterson is more well known for his musical talents he also operated the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto between 1960 and 1962 before his touring commitments forced its closure.  Peterson held 12 honourary degrees throughout his life and was the chancellor at York University from 1991 to 1994.  In 2010 York University launched Oscar Peterson Scholarships in his honour.  The scholarships offered $40000 as an entrance scholarship and up to four $10000 scholarships for undergraduate music students.  

In 1993 he suffered a stroke which hampered his ability to play the piano.  Undeterred he continued to play shows until 2006. In 2002 he released his autobiography A Jazz Odyssey: The Life of Oscar Peterson.   In 2005 he became the first living person to be commemorated on a postage stamp other than a reigning monarch.  

Sadly Peterson passed away in 2007.  His music and legacy live on.  #BlackExcellence #BHMyrdsb",0

"Herbert (Herb) H. Carnegie broke barriers and inspired others throughout his life - both on the ice and off. 
Carnegie came into the world on November 8 1919 and it didn’t take him long to indulge himself in one of his country’s national pastimes. “I’d loved the game since I was seven and a half” he told The Globe and Mail in 2006. He was good at it too and aspired to don the blue and white of the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
Carnegie had an opportunity to try out for the National Hockey League’s New York Rangers but turned it down due to lack of adequate compensation. “In revisiting this experience with my father” said his daughter Bernice “he was clearly disappointed with their offer to the minors and the pay cut especially since he had been just voted Most Valuable Player on his team and would go on to receive this distinction for two more consecutive years.  In the end it should be noted that players with lesser records advanced into the NHL.” It would be several more years before Willie O’Ree would break the colour barrier in the NHL. 
Carnegie chased his dream in the Quebec Professional Hockey League (QPHL). He played for teams in Shawinigan Sherbrooke and Quebec City.  His stats remained among the league’s elite posting over a point-per-game (PPG) in his first seven seasons in the league.  In his best season he posted 127 points in just 56 games a PPG of almost 2.27. 
He also became a member of one of the most prolific lines in hockey known as the “Black Aces” many years before other famous lines such as Philadelphia's “Legion of Doom” or Buffalo’s “French Connection” took to the ice.  He centred his older brother Ossie and Manny McIntyre on the famous line. Carnegie played one season outside the QPHL at the end of his career with the Owen Sound Mercurys of the Ontario Hockey Association Senior A League (OHASr). He brought his scoring touch with him collecting 55 points in 54 games.  He called it a career in 1954 after a single season in Owen Sound.

"Long before he was the namesake for Lincoln Alexander P.S. in Markham Lincoln Alexander was breaking barriers for Canadians across the country. 
A first generation Canadian Alexander was born in Toronto in 1922. His mother was from Jamaica and his father (also named Lincoln Alexander) was from St. Vincent. He served in the Royal Canadian Airforce in World War II between 1942-1945 before returning to Canada when the war was over. He marriedYvonne in 1948 and their son Keith was born one year later. 
Alexander graduated from McMaster University with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1949.  Following this he graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School and was called to the Bar in 1953. 
He began his political career in 1965 running as a member of the Conservative Party.  He was narrowly defeated in his first campaign for office however he remained undeterred and was elected to his first term in 1968 at which time he became Canada’s first Black member of parliament (MP). Alexander was re-elected multiple times holding a seat until 1980.  He continued to blaze new trails while in office becoming Canada’s first Black cabinet minister in 1979 handling the Labour portfolio for Prime Minister Joe Clark until 1980.  He resigned his seat in 1980 when Ontario Premier Bill Davis appointed him Chair of the Ontario Workers’ Compensation Board a title Alexander held for the next five years. 
He wasn’t done with politics though. Alexander became the first Black Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario in 1985. He was appointed to the position at the recommendation of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He held this position until 1991 when he was named Chancellor at the University of Guelph.  He remained chancellor at the university until 2007. 
In 1992 he was named an officer of the Order of Ontario and a Companion to the Order of Canada. 
Five years later in 1997 Alexander became the Chair of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation. 
In 2006 he released his memoir; Go To School You’re A Little Black Boy.

"​If you asked the average Grade 3 student to name their favourite musicians you would likely expect to hear a myriad of popular artists.  This is not true of David Martin. The Buttonville P.S. student lists Vivaldi and Bach among his favourites (although he is also a big fan of Lil Nas X especially his song Old Town Road). It's the music of the f​irst two though that David plays on stage. 
David has been playing the violin since he was five years old. His family was living in Jamaica at the time. David’s mother Jeneva encouraged his interest in the instrument saying she “was always fascinated by the violin and wanted to play it (herself).” She’s also the first to admit that she wasn’t the first person to see her son’s natural ability that person was his tutor Steven Woodham. 
Woodham is a well-known violinist from Jamaica. When he saw the gift David had for the violin he said to Jeneva “David has something really really special that I have not seen in years in a child and please please please don’t let him stop playing.” So when the Martins moved to Canada they found a new tutor (Ryan Ip) for David and his abilities have continued to grow building on his early teachings from Woodham. 
David was the youngest person in the Carribean to receive a distinction from the Associate Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) in 2018 when he completed the Grade 2 music examination at the age of six.  He enjoys playing music and practices about 45 minutes each day. He has performed at the North York Unionville and Newmarket Music Festivals and won his categories. 
While he enjoys using his own creativity to personalize pieces of music David’s favourite piece to play is Seitz’s Concerto Note 5 Movement 3. His favourite audience? “My mom my dad my uncle and my cousins.” The young violinist doesn’t feel any jealousy from his classmates over his achievements and he’s happy to help them when they need it. “I taught them music is not just about playing notes” David said. He added that musicians also have to count beats and play the song as it is outlined on their music sheet.

"We know families have questions about what learning online will look like. Our teachers are taking a scaffolded approach to implement this. This week teachers will complete 3 major steps. Please check out our story for links to the Learning and Caring page on the Board website. .

STEP 1 - As we noted yesterday this week our teachers are calling or emailing students to check in and identify the needs of students and families and point them towards helpful online supports. .

STEP 2 -  In order to move learning opportunities online teachers need a learning platform. Step 2 involves teachers identifying a platform that will best meet the needs of their students. Each platform has tools to support learning and collaboration. .

STEP 3 - The final step for this week is to begin planning for learning and building an inclusive safe and accessible online environment. Teachers will prepare the learning environment to receive students and will complete a curriculum check. .

"Motivated by her lived experiences Kamilah Clayton has spent the majority of her adult life advocating for what she believes in and working to create a more equitable world for everyone. “Most of my life has been dedicated to highlighting issues related to the Black community in the Greater Toronto Area” she explained. .

Despite her strong passion for equity and advocacy Clayton didn’t go into social work immediately after high school instead opting for a more general psychology degree. “I actually didn’t know what I wanted to do when I left high school but my parents said ‘you have to go to university’” Clayton laughed. “Psychology is very general so I thought that a lot of the classes would allow me to figure out what I wanted to do.” .

She came to social work when a trusted mentor suggested it to her. Clayton’s mentor was a social worker herself with a strong history of social justice work in both Nova Scotia and Ontario. “She was so inspirational. If she felt that I had the capacity to be a social worker I wanted to honour that” Clayton said. Sadly her mentor passed away just a few months before Clayton finished her undergraduate degree in social work. Undeterred Clayton honoured her friend by continuing her schooling graduating with a Masters Degree and becoming a practicing social worker. She has held a number of professional social work positions including currently working with a child welfare agency in the Greater Toronto Area. .

Clayton is striving to create a better world for the next generation starting with her own children.  She recalled a story of taking her daughter to the grocery store and her daughter wanted to bring a toy in with her. She immediately thought “somebody’s going to assume she stole it then we’re going to end up in a room somewhere.” .

Unfortunately Clayton knows what it’s like to have to be hyper-vigilant due to stereotypes.  She wants to change the experience for her children... Read Kamilah's full story on our Celebrating Black Excellence page at yrdsb.ca. #BHMyrdsb #BlackExcellence #BeyondBHM",0

"“George look how far we’ve come from 1982!” Paul Jones yelled to George Cope the now-retired executive at Bell Canada from the side of the court after game six of the NBA Finals at California’s Oakland Arena. .

It wasn’t the first time Jones and Cope had worked together in basketball; Jones coached Cope as a player at the University of Western Ontario but an NBA championship was new to both of them. Cope was there representing Bell Canada; the company has an ownership stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment the company that owns the Raptors. Jones was there doing what he’s been doing for 35 years talking basketball. .

Jones or “Jonesy” as his friends call him has loved basketball all his life. .

Originally from Jamaica Jones moved to Canada when he was only five months old. He describes his family’s journey to Canada as one of “initiative.” His father had visited Canada to see his sister who was in law school at the University of Toronto and he decided to stay bringing his wife and young son up shortly after. Jones pointed out that it was ironic that his father passed on the top radio job in Jamaica to remain in Canada where both Paul and his brother Mark would become broadcasters. .

Broadcasting isn’t the only thing that runs in Jones’ family. . “My grandfather was a teacher and a principal in Africa and in England” he explained. Jones would eventually follow in his grandfather’s footsteps obtaining a Masters in Sports Psychology and a teaching degree at York University and the University of Western Ontario. He continued to play basketball through his undergrad playing on two all-star teams and being named a Finals MVP while at York. He also spent some time playing professionally in Europe. .

While at Western he got into coaching spending one year with the women’s team and two years with the men’s team. It was his love of coaching that brought him to teaching. Jones started as an occasional teacher with Toronto District School Board in 1984 and joined York Region District School Board (YRDSB) as a Principal in 1999. .

"Richard Walters describes himself as a passionate upcoming artist who dabbles in acting music and dance however he also considers himself a dreamer and hopes his fans feel the same way. “Beyonce has her beehives” Walters explains. “My followers are the dreamers.” Walters was very young when he discovered his love of music and dance.  One day when he was a child his daycare attendant put on Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson. “It got my attention as soon as I heard it I wondered who this person was” Walters said. “I would say Michael Jackson is the main reason I started doing what I do.” Long before he was walking the red carpet at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) Walters was refining his craft. He wrote his first song called Speak around the time he entered high school speaking out against bullying. “To quote the song ‘if you’re looking for help but nobody hears you you have to speak’” Walters explained. 
Walters began to see acting as a potential career after he was accepted to the drama program at Unionville High School. He credits teachers Aaron Bieman and Robert Cook for creating a safe environment to learn as a young actor. 
While most of his classmates were collecting their diplomas and looking to move on to post-secondary or the working world Walters was preparing to go to a new high school this one “a lot more dramatic” than Unionville H.S.. He joined the cast of Degrassi a show that has spawned stars such as Drake. Walters’ success speaks to his perseverance; it was on his seventh audition that he landed the role of Tiny Bell. He had acted before first appearing on The Family Channel’s The Next Step as a dancer. However Degrassi he said was his biggest project to date. 
He has worked on many projects since then and has been nominated for numerous awards.  One of the highlights of his career was attending TIFF when one of the films he appeared in American Woman was screened at the festival. He was able to walk the red carpet meet fans and have his mother attend the film screening.

Long before he was working in schools Hart was an Infantry Soldier in the Jamaican Military.  He served with the Jamaican Armed Forces between 1984 and 1992.  It was his time in the Jamaican Military that led him to both the Olympics and to Canada. 
The Jamaican Bobsled team practiced on military property. Once Hart learned more about the sport and their need for strong sprinters he joined the team. He went on to compete with the team in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville France.

"Technology can seem impersonal at times. Ashley Jane Lewis a New Media graduate from Toronto’s Ryerson University is working to change that. “Code drives the way that we are able to access community through social media code drives the algorithms that determine what my insurance package looks like code drives the algorithms that determine where I am first offered opportunities to live code drives the systems that categorize my identity in government files” she explained when talking about why it is important to develop technology with a human lens. “I think for a long time perhaps ever the existence of technology has not centered humans and therefore has created a lot of unempathetic inaccurate and biased systems… If that’s going to change at all we have to change the origin point of how we produce technology and make it more human centred.” This is something she would include when she taught code later on. 
Lewis didn’t enter the New Media program with a goal of changing how machines think in fact she almost went into post-secondary for clarinet an instrument she played in her high school concert band. An artist from a very young age the program ended up blending a couple of her interests together; “I was really interested in the hybridity of technology and art and it’s capacity to reach more people than the audience who are standing in front of your piece"" she said. Lewis admits she didn’t know she would be coding when she entered the program. She recalls wondering “what have I gotten myself into?” on her first day of school when she learned her program involved coding and math a subject she didn’t enjoy in high school. 
The way Lewis learned to code greatly impacted the way she would teach it later on although it was not through emulation. “(When) I found myself in a position to start teaching code it was really through social activity and game-oriented learning that I structured my workshops…

"Dear families

ETFO has announced that beginning on January 13 2020 they will begin phase three of work-to-rule strike sanctions.

The third phase of the work-to-rule strike sanctions add to the sanctions announced in phase two in December. While previous sanctions were mostly administrative in nature during the third phase students and families will begin to notice some activities being withdrawn. 
Of note the phase 3 work-to-rule strike sanctions will mean that elementary school teachers across public schools in Ontario will: -Not participate in extra-curricular activities except for those scheduled within the school day. -Not participate in field trips. -Not arrive at school any earlier than 30 minutes before the start of the day and not stay later than 15 minutes after the end of the day. - Not participate in assemblies except to provide student supervision. 
ETFO also announced phase four strike sanctions effective January 20. In phase four ETFO has announced that teachers will participate in rotating one-day strikes if a deal is not reached. We do not yet have details on the timing of the rotating strike which will impact schools at the York Region District School Board and will provide information as early as possible. The full list of sanctions by ETFO is available on the Board’s website. 
We know this is disappointing for students and families.  Your child’s school will provide additional information regarding extra-curricular activities events and field trips that may have to be cancelled as a result of this work-to-rule strike action. 
Student safety continues to be our priority and we continue to make contingency plans and work to minimize the impact of labour sanctions on students.
